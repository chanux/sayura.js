Sayura.js
=========

*Javascript implementation of Sayura quasi-transliteration scheme*

With sayura.js you can have the ease of [sayura](http://www.sayura.net/im/)
sinhala phonetic input method's awesomeness pretty much anywhere.

Annoyances (I'd hopefully fix)
----------
- [ ] You can't go back to a place in text and edit there.

How to use?
----------

Add sayura.js to your website.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chanux/sayura.js/android-support/sayura.js"></script>
```

To disable/enable sayura, just call `sayura.toggle()` in event of your liking.
Check index.html for an example.
